## 🧠 Overview

This project builds a simple AI agent that:
- Scrapes Deep Learning course details from websites
- Captures screenshots of the pages
- Uses OpenAI to filter and recommend courses based on a given topic (e.g., **RAG**)

Perfect for learning how to use:
- Web scraping with Python
- Prompting OpenAI models
- Organizing structured outputs
